// Passing a Class as a Parameter: A class can be passed to a function using an object, reference, or pointer. Passing by reference or pointer avoids unnecessary copying and improves efficiency.

/*Returning a Class from a Function: 
A function can return a class in different ways:-
1. Returning an object (returns a copy). 
2. Returning a pointer (useful for dynamic memory allocation). 
3.Returning a reference (must ensure the object exists). 
4. Returning a class type (useful in factory patterns).*/
